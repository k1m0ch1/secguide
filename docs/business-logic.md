I Assume there is no tools to make sure your functionality is secure, to understand this section, you need to test every point to check if secure enough

## Functionality

- [ ] Some app provides you with an option to provide a rating on a scale of 1 to 5, try to go beyond/below the scale-like provide 0 or 6
- [ ] Try to see if the same user can post multiple ratings for a product. This is an interesting endpoint to check for Race Conditions
